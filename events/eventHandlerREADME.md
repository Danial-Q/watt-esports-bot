# Event Handler

Each discord.js event has been split into it's own file

To add a new event, create a file in the `/events/` directory, and this **HAS** to be named the exact same as as discord.js event, passing on the correct arguments ([Docs here](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/class/Client))

If the event already exists, you can do into the corresponding file and add the functionality into that file.
